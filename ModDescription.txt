This mod makes commanders do three things: 1.- Commanders will spawn armies at the end of each round (At the end of each round because this way the AI is better at predicting defending armies). 2.-Whenever a commander is part of a defending or attacking army a percentage of casualties will be replenished. 3.-Whenever a commander is part of a defending or attacking army a percentage of the surviving enemy armies will flee (die for practical purposes). Note: This effect only applies to armies that were actually involved in the fight and not to all armies in the attacking territory. Note 2: The replenishment and flee effects happen after the fight is resolved, if the commander does not survive the fight the player looses the game.

All three options can be configured in the mod interface. This allows commanders to go from giving a small advantage in fights to being able to eliminate entire armies.
